# A webpage for used study books.

This is a web project that was required by OAMK's Online Service course project. This web site was made by 5 contributors.
We have used and implemented the following technologies:

1)React JS

2)SQL

3)PHP

4)Bootstrap

The idea was to combine front-end and back-end technologies into a functional website.
