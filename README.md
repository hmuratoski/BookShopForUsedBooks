# A webpage for used study books.

This web-project was required for OAMK's Online Service course and was made by 4 contributors.
We have used and implemented the following technologies:

1) React JS
2) SQLite
3) PHP
4) Bootstrap

The idea was to combine front-end and back-end technologies into a functional website.
